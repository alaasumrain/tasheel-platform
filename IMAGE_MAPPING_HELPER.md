2. **Match it to the description** below
3. **Rename it** to the exact name required

## 💡 **OPTION: I CAN HELP YOU AUTOMATE THIS**

If you want, I can create a script that:
1. Lists all your `creation_*.png` files
2. You tell me which number matches which service
3. I rename them all automatically

**OR** you can manually rename them using the guide above!

Which do you prefer?
